# Malware-classification-using-Malimg-dataset

## Main problem: 
Malware is any malicious code or a program that can be harmful to the computer. 
There are many types of malwares, and itâ€™s essential to detect these types to prevent 
their breaches to keep the data and the system private and secured.

## Dataset: 
The Malimg dataset consists of 9339 images and 25 classes. The following table 
represents the class and type of the included malwares:

## Solution: 
The main idea is to predict which Family/Class the malware belongs to by extracting 
the important features from the images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), so 
this problem can be considered as a multiclassification problem.
