# Malware-classification-using-Malimg-dataset

## Main problem: 
Malware is any malicious code or a program that can be harmful to the computer. 
There are many types of malwares, and it’s essential to detect these types to prevent 
their breaches to keep the data and the system private and secured.

## Dataset: 
The Malimg dataset consists of 9339 images and 25 classes. The following table 
represents the class and type of the included malwares:

## Solution: 
The main idea is to predict which Family/Class the malware belongs to by extracting 
the important features from the images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), so 
this problem can be considered as a multiclassification problem.
